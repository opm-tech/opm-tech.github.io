## 🛠 Skills
Learning: HTML, CSS, Python.

Pretty good with different types of design, no particular tech mastered though.

- Tons of other non-tech skills. Worked with my hands in construction mostly. Concrete finishing and sheetrock finishing were my favorite.

- Worked some retail as management and it was decent, the pay was just very low for the amount of difficult people and situations you had to deal with.
